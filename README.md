# Coordman for MinecraftMapper

**Coordman for MinecraftMapper** is a specialized edition of Coordman that integrates fully within the MinecraftMapper application.
> _Shout-out to [Rebane](https://github.com/rebane2001) for the [original Coordman](https://github.com/rebane2001/coordman), without the original I probably never started working on this._
